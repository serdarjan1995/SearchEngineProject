##This file has code to connect and disconnect to a database. This requires the user to have configured a MySQL database first.
##host should be local, and fields 'user','password','database' depend on the user.

#CONNECT TO DB
import mysql.connector

# Connect to MySQL
conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host='localhost',
    user='root',
    password='',
    database='test'
)
cursor = conn.cursor()


#Disconnect DB

conn.close()
